Topic: Language identification
Difficulty: Medium
Description:
Language detection is a very important step in many other NLP based machine learning models like text classification tools or task facilitation tools like translating or speech to text software.

This problem is an Natural Language Processing problem. The main challenge is to first convert the text (String) into vectors that are readable by your machine. We advice you to make some research on what is a “token”, and what is “word embedding”. Here is some useful keywords to for your research (Tfidf, word2vec, ngram …). For this challenge you can use any library you desire (sklearn, tensorflow, pytorch…)

The provided dataset contains 31012 labeled text in 28 languages. Some sentences can be amazon reviews, others are random sentences.
In total, there are 24326 training samples and 6686 testing samples. For each sample, you have a label which corresponds to one of the 28 languages :
['Turkish', 'Korean', 'Arabic', 'English', 'Swedish', 'Tamil', 'Greek', 'Dutch', 'Portugese', 'Latin', 'French', 'Persian', 'Chinese', 'Spanish', 'Estonian', 'Indonesian', 'Romanian', 'Thai', 'Malayalam', 'Hindi', 'Russian', 'Japanese', 'Italian', 'Pushto','Kannada', 'Urdu', 'German', 'Danish']

Goals:
The goal of this challenge is to detect the language of a text.

Criteria: 
We will score your submissions based on F-1 score. The score on the leadboard is the harmonic mean between the f1 score and the other metrics if applicable.

This challenge will require you to have a model that can accurately predict the language of a text.

A presentation of the method used by the winners will be requested. The code must also be given.
